## Unclear File/Folder Namings

1. **`run.sh` → `start_video_interview.sh`**  
   Rationale: The original name doesn't specify the purpose; the new name clarifies that this script starts the video interview process.

2. **`streamlit_app.py` → `video_interview_streamlit_app.py`**  
   Rationale: The new name includes context about what the Streamlit app relates to, avoiding future confusion about the app’s functionality.

3. **`video_processing.py` → `video_interview_processing.py`**  
   Rationale: Adding context directly ties the script to the main project, making it more understandable for new users or collaborators.

## Reorganization Suggestions

### Logical Top-Level Structure
- **Top-Level Categories**:
  - **Source Code**: Contains all code files.
  - **Configuration**: Contains files like Docker configurations.
  - **Documentation**: Houses README.md and other documentation.
  - **Models**: This could be for storage of any machine learning models, separated here for clarity.
  - **Temp**: This directory should remain but could be utilized for temporary files only during development/testing phases.

### Suggested Merges/Splits and Consolidation
- **Merge**: No immediate merges are suggested as the current categories are appropriate, but consider integrating `streamlit_app.py` and `video_processing.py` into a **Source Code** folder.
- **Archive**: If `temp` is not actively used, consider archiving or removing its contents to keep the directory clear.

### README.md Placement
- Place a **README.md** file in the top-level directory to provide context for all subdirectories and files, explaining the project scope, usage, and structure, particularly since this is a project that may require onboarding for new developers. 

### Additional Notes
- Monitor the size of the **temp** directory; if it grows significantly, investigate its purpose or necessity. Consider creating a README within this directory if it becomes more relevant in the future.
